### WIFI CONFIGURATION ######################################################
# The three segments below should cover you in most cases if you run
# a wifi network that uses either WPA/WPA2 or WEP encryption.
#
# Just uncomment the lines prefixed with a single # of the configuration
# that matches your wifi setup and fill in SSID and passphrase.
#
# If you need to configure more than 1 wifi network, please use /boot/octopi-wpa-supplicant.txt instead
#
# ATTENTION: please note that the raspberry pi 3 internal wifi does currently not support the wifi channels 12 and 13

## WPA/WPA2 secured
#iface wlan0-octopi inet manual
#    wpa-ssid "put SSID here"
#    wpa-psk "put password here"

## WEP secured
#iface wlan0-octopi inet manual
#    wireless-essid "put SSID here"
#    wireless-key "put password here"

## Open/unsecured
#iface wlan0-octopi inet manual
#    wireless-essid "put SSID here"
#    wireless-mode managed

### WIRED CONFIGURATION WITH DHCP ###########################################
# Nothing to do, OctoPi is already preconfigured that way. Just plug in your
# cable, wait for an IP to be assigned and stuff should work out of the box
# just fine.

### WIRED CONFIGURATION WITH STATIC IP ######################################
# The following segment allows you to configure your wired connection
# with a static IP.
#
# Just uncomment the lines prefixed with a single #. Then connect 
# a cable to the Pi and another system, e.g. a Laptop, and set that
# other system's network configuration to:
#
#   address:   192.168.250.10
#   netmask:   255.255.255.0
#   broadcast: 192.168.250.255
#
# You can then reach the Pi from the system's browser by going to
#
#   http://192.168.250.1
#
# or
#
#   http://octopi.local

#auto eth0:1
#iface eth0:1 inet static
#  address 192.168.250.1
#  netmask 255.255.255.0
#  broadcast 192.168.250.255


### OLD CONFIG ########################################
## interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)
#
## Please note that this file is written to be used with dhcpcd
## For static IP, consult /etc/dhcpcd.conf and 'man dhcpcd.conf'
